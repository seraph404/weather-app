# Weather App

This project is part of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course. [You can read more about this project here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app). This project is designed as practice for working with APIs.

## Key takeaways

The biggest lesson I learned from this project is the value of sketching out the HTML (and CSS) structure before jumping into JavaScript to dynamically build the interface. Having a predefined layout made it much easier to implement dynamic elements smoothly. In the past, I often skipped this step in my eagerness to dive into JS, but this time it really paid off.

I’m also proud of figuring out how to dynamically build the weather card content, despite the “daily” and “weekly” forecasts having slightly different data structures. I finally put reusable code patterns into practice, which made development more efficient and reduced redundancy, even though I had to refactor halfway through to make it work.
